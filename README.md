## 💡 Solution Description:
“App Name” is a prototype application created during the 2025 ESGI X Softeam hackathon. The application is designed to facilitate decision-making for the establishment of medical homes and the allocation of doctors to reduce tensions in medical zones.
This platform provides a dynamic digital space where members of the medical community can connect, check offers, and identify geographical areas in need to contact municipalities. Additionally, elected officials can use this solution to monitor the real-time status of their territories.
